# Hello
Hi, my name is BLINMATIC, I am a personal coder. 
I have a good knowledge of Python 3 as i have been using it since June 2020.
I self taught myself many languages but I stuck around with Python as it is the easiest to develop with.

# How Did I Get Into Programming?
At 4th grade, our school had a computer club. As you might expect we learned Scratch in there. And for 2 years, I coded with Scratch.
At this time, I had an interest in programming but since I was so small, It was so hard for me to develop anything.

# My First Real Programming Language And How I Got Introduced To It
At the very start of the pandemic when schools closed for a long time I used to get really bored so I would play modded Minecraft. A lot of it.
I was adding lots of mods. And while adding mods one time, a mod called `OpenComputers` caught my interest. It had computers programmable in Lua.
After that for 3 months, I would learn lua. Untill I found about Python.
That's when I really started programming. Especially with the Tkinter module. And later, Pygame.
After that nothing interesting really happened. I just kept impoving myself.

# More About Me
I know 3 languages:
1. English (Fluent)
2. Turkish (Native)
3. Japanese (Somewhat)


Altough my native language is Turkish, Since I speak English more, I know more English than Turkish.
I am actually better than the average at math and solve equations faster. My favourite subject in school is physics and least favourite is IT.
##### Why do I hate IT a lot?
Because I already know everything the teacher is teaching so i just stare at a blank screen for 40 minutes.
