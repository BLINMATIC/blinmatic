# Hello
Hi, my name is BLINMATIC, I am a personal programmer. 
I have a good knowledge of Python 3 as i have been using it since June 2020.
I self taught myself many languages but I stuck around with Python as it is the easiest to develop with.

# How Did I Get Into Programming?
At 4th grade, our school had a computer club. As you might expect we learned Scratch in there. And for 2 years, I coded with Scratch.
At this time, I had an interest in programming but since I was so small, It was so hard for me to develop anything.

# My First Real Programming Language And How I Got Introduced To It
At the very start of the pandemic when schools closed for a long time I used to get really bored so I would play modded Minecraft. A lot of it. (I am talking 10 hours a day or something here)
I was adding lots of mods. And while adding mods one time, a mod called `OpenComputers` caught my interest. It had computers programmable in the Programming Language Lua.
After that for 3 months, I would learn lua. Untill I found about Python.
That's when I really started programming. Especially with the Tkinter module. And later, Pygame.
After that nothing interesting really happened. I just kept impoving myself.

# More About Me
I know 3 languages:
1. English (Fluent)
2. Turkish (Native)
3. Japanese (Somewhat)

My native language is Turkish but, I do read and listen more English media, I know more English. I am also good at things like math, woodworking, physics and I try to protect Turkish and Japanese by avoiding loanwords and creating my own words or using old native ones.
I also don't really use Social Media or Watch anything so what do i do in my free time? I just sit and wait for time to pass by.

# How Did I Get Into Japanese.
So there is this Minecraft mod Called RealTrainMod made by a Japanese guy, and the mod is not that really well translated so to learn what was writing I would use Bing Translator. But one day I found out that Turkish and Japanese are actually quite similar in structure and I think that Japanese is one of the easiest languages you can learn. So I started in April with Duolingo untill a December 2023 where I started to think that Duolingo is not effective anymore. So, I cleared my youtube, set the location and the language to Japan and now i am learning like that. (The same way how I learned English).
# Attempts With Other Languages Before
3 Years ago, I tried learning Russian but stopped after 1 week. Then 2 Years ago, I tried learning German but only made it until 1 week due to school. Last I tried learning Dutch for 1 month Last year and found it too hard. But before all of this I actually tried learning Japanese 5 years ago. But I stopped after 3 days because my younger brain could not comprehend it
